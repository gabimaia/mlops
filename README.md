## Mlops deploy to heart disease predict
This repo holds my first project in machine learning component on PPGEEC.

The main purposes is using a fastAPI to deploy a predict model for heart disease, based on "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(heart)" dataset 
This repository contains the first project of the Machine Learning discipline guided by Prof. Dr. Ivanovitch Medeiros (at UFRN)

The objective of the project is to carry out and implement a model capable of a decision tree capable of predicting the existence or not of heart disease from the physiological signs of patients.

For this we will use WandB + FastAPI + Heroku.

Students: Jord√£o Silva and Gabriel Maia
